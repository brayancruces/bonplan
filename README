Bonplan website project

What is it?
================

This is a french project based on idea of "bonplan", means tips.
The project started from a homework's friend who studied in design school.
The topic was : "Do an original, responsive, and beautiful website design."
He did it. So i would like to render this design more dynamical.

It's a little simple website so i am using Silex.
